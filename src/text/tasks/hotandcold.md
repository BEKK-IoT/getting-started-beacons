# Hot and cold

One usecase for beacons is treasure hunting or scavenger hunt. Here are some examples: Asiaâ€™s First iBeacon [Treasure Hunt](http://blog.beaconstac.com/2016/02/asias-first-ibeacon-treasure-hunt-powered-by-beaconstac/) powered by Beaconstac and Hacking the CES [Scavenger Hunt](http://makezine.com/2016/01/07/hacking-ces-scavenger-hunt-second-time/). Next easter you could hide iBeacons in your easter eggs!



## Task
Make an application that tells you when you get closer to an iBeacon and when you get further away. You can do this with the node app or on the phone using Cordova. If you use the phone, it is possible to visualize the distance with colors (maybe from blue to red?).
