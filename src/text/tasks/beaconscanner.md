# Beacon scanner (Ranging)

Apps can interact with beacons in two ways: Monitoring and Ranging. Monitoring allows you to scan for beacon regions, while Ranging is for interacting with individual beacons. This task address the Ranging aspect.

Ranging allows for continuously scanning of beacons. It's the mode used when trying to measure key values like distance more accurate.

It's time to interact with the beacons in the room.

## Tasks
Some of these tasks can be done in both Node and Cordova

  1. Start Ranging for beacons. Log the found beacons to the console.

  2. Only Range for one particular beacon.

  3. __Cordova:__ Show the found beacons in the mobile view, not only in the console.

All the beacons for this workshop
should have the same UUID, so if you see some other beacons, they are not ours.
