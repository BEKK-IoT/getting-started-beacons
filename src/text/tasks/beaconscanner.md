# Beacon scanner

It's time to interact with the beacons in the room.

## Tasks
Some of these tasks can be done in both Node and Cordova

- Start Ranging for beacons. Log the found beacons to the console.
- Only Range for one particular beacon.
- __Cordova:__ Show the found beacons in the mobile view, not only in the console.

` `

All the beacons for this workshop
should have the same UUID, so if you see some other beacons, they are not ours.

Our UUID: B9407F30-F5F8-466E-AFF9-25556B57FE6D
