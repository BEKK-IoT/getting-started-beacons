# Hot and cold

One usecase for beacons is treasure hunting or scavenger hunt. Here are some examples: [Asiaâ€™s First iBeacon Treasure Hunt powered by Beaconstac](http://blog.beaconstac.com/2016/02/asias-first-ibeacon-treasure-hunt-powered-by-beaconstac/) and [Hacking the CES Scavenger Hunt for a Second Time](http://makezine.com/2016/01/07/hacking-ces-scavenger-hunt-second-time/). Next easter you could hide iBeacons in your easter eggs!



## Task

Make an application that tells you when you get closer to an iBeacon and when you get further away. You can do this with the node app or on the phone using cordova. If use use the phone, it is possible to visualize the distance with colors. A bonus task could be to show notifications (could be console.log() or something visual) when you are close to an iBeacon.
