# Photon

The Photon is a tiny micro-controller. It costs $19 and is a complete Wi-Fi development kit for creating connected projects.
Today Photon is thought by many as **THE** product to use for creating Internet of Things projects.
Netflix has even created a [*"Netflix button"*](http://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch) by using a Photon.
It's small, powerful, easy to use, and it is connected to the cloud.
